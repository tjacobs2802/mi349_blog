                <p>Author: fantasyfootballlover46, Published: 10/09/2024, </p>
                <p>The Davante Adams situation is very intriguing. Everyone knows that Adams is leaving Las Vegas for greener pastures, 
                    there’s no doubts about that. However, where he lands could drastically change his value in both dynasty and redraft leagues. 
                    Right now the favorite is the Jets, to land him with his buddy Aaron Rodgers. From a glance, that looks like a pretty decent move. 
                    But taking a closer look, we can see that Rodgers already has some decent receivers in Allen Lazard and Garrett Wilson. 
                    Oh yeah, about Garrett Wilson, they did just fire Robert Saleh, so the chances his targets go up is going to increase a LOT in the next couple of games. 
                    However, one team that has been rumored is the Kansas City Chiefs. If he goes to the Chiefs, he will instantly be a top 5 receiver option in all leagues. 
                    Right now, nobody on the Chiefs roster (except for Travis Kelce, but he’s being doubled a lot this year) can even sniff the amount of 
                    production that Davante Adams puts up on a yearly basis. He would instantly become Patrick Mahomes’ favorite receiver, 
                    and it would allow Adams to get back to his prime Green Bay numbers.</p>

                <p>Author: LetsGoLions25, published: 10/10/2024</p>
                <p>Amon-Ra St. Brown is a better fantasy option than Justin Jefferson. I said it. Who is Justin Jefferson’s quarterback again? That’s right, it’s Sam Darnold. 
                    Are we really going to sit here, and tell eachother LIES about how Sam Darnold can get the ball to JJ better than Jared Goff can get the ball to the sun god????? 
                    Come on, what’re we doing??? This Cinderella run for Sam Darnold is about to end, just wait and see. Besides, it’s an indisputable fact that Amon-Ra is more durable than Jefferson. 
                    Look at how many times they’ve been injured in the last 3 seasons, and look at how many games each of them played. St. Brown LITERALLY tore his oblique off of the bone!!!! 
                    AND STILL PLAYED????? WHO DOES THAT???? Amon-Ra, the absolute DAWG that he is, that’s who!! Also, speaking of the uncertainty at quarterback with the Vikings, who knows how the connection 
                    between JJ McCarthy and Justin Jefferson will be. Obviously it will be good, but we don’t know for sure until JJ McCarthy steps on the field, and that won’t happen until next year. 
                    However, we KNOW who the Lions qb will be for years to come, and his name is Jared Goff.</p>
