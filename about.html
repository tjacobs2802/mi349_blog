        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Trevor Jacobs and I am the author of the Fantasy Football Blog. 
            Currently I am a fifth year senior at Michigan State University, and made this blog
            as a class project. The goal I had in mind when making this was to be a host 
            for anyone to give their opinions on the hottest fantasy football topics. Topics will be
            updated day to day, giving the users something new to talk about every day they use the
            blog site. This is not only a great way to get your fantasy opinions heard, but also a way
            connect with fans all across the globe. Thank you for using my blog, go Lions!
        </p>
